<!-- Title: Manual Car -->

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
  Jakarta is infamous for its congested traffic. 
  Bu Dengklek is often bothered by this condition, especially since her car is a manual car with numerous gears.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">

</p>
<p>
  Bu Dengklek's car has $N$ gears, numbered from $1$ to $N$.
  At any point in time, her car can only be in exactly one gear.
  If her car is in the $i$-th gear, its speed can only be between $L_i$ and $R_i$ inclusive.
</p>
<p>
  Bu Dengklek would like to drive her car for $M$ minutes.
  At the $i$-th minute, she wants her car's speed to be $A_i$.
  Bu Dengklek can choose <b>any gear for her initial gear</b>. 
  Between each minute, Bu Dengklek is allowed to shift gears.
  At each minute, the current gear must accommodate the required speed.
</p>
<p>
  Shifting gears every minute risks damaging the gear shift mechanism.
  Hence, she would like to minimize the number of gear shifts.
  What is the minimum number of gear shifts that would accommodate Bu Dengklek's speed requirements?
  Or report if it is impossible to satisfy all speed requirements!
</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
  <li>$1 \leq N, M \leq 100\,000$</li>
  <li>$1 \leq L_i \leq R_i \leq 10^9$</li>
  <li>$1 \leq A_i \leq 10^9$</li>
</ul>

<h3>Subtasks</h3>

<ol>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;(5 points) $N = 1$; $M = 1$</li>
  <li>(15 points) $R_i &lt; L_{i + 1}$</li>
  <li>(19 points) $N, M \leq 100$</li>
  <li>(11 points) $N, M \leq 2000$</li>
  <li>(15 points) $L_i &lt; L_{i + 1}$; $R_i &lt; R_{i + 1}$; $A_i \leq A_{i + 1}$</li>
  <li>(16 points) $A_i \leq A_{i + 1}$</li>
  <li>(19 points) No additional constraints.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Input</h3>

<p>
  The input is given in the following format:
</p>
<pre>
N
L<sub>1</sub> R<sub>1</sub>
L<sub>2</sub> R<sub>2</sub>
&vellip;
L<sub>N</sub> R<sub>N</sub>

<h3>Explanation of Sample 1</h3>

<p>
  Bu Dengklek can carry out the following strategy:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Set the initial gear to the $1$-st gear.</li>
  <li>The speed requirement for the $1$-st minute is satisfied since $1 \leq 3 \leq 4$.</li>
  <li>Shift to the $4$-th gear.</li>
  <li>The speed requirement for the $2$-nd minute is satisfied since $8 \leq 8 \leq 10$.</li>
  <li>The speed requirement for the $3$-rd minute is satisfied since $8 \leq 10 \leq 10$.</li>
  <li>Shift to the $1$-st gear.</li>
  <li>The speed requirement for the $4$-th minute is satisfied since $1 \leq 2 \leq 4$.</li>
  <li>Shift to the $2$-nd gear.</li>
  <li>The speed requirement for the $5$-th minute is satisfied since $7 \leq 7 \leq 7$.</li>
  <li>The speed requirement for the $6$-th minute is satisfied since $7 \leq 7 \leq 7$.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  There are $3$ gear shifts.
