<!-- Title: Batavia Defense -->

<h3>Description</h3>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="render/bamburuncing.png" style="width: 400px;">
</p>
<p>
  Si Pitung is leading his troops to defend Batavia.
  There are $N$ soldiers lined up in one line.
  Initially, the soldier at position $i$ from the front has power $A_i$.
</p>
<p>
  Si Pitung can carry out two types of commands:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Rotation command:
    command the soldier at the end of the line to move to the front of the line.
  </li>
  <li>
    Extension command:
    add a new soldier with any power to the end of the line.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Si Pitung has an integer $K$.
  For a line consisting of $c$ soldiers, an interval $[x, y]$ ($1 \leq x \leq y \leq c$) is <b>solid</b> if and only if both of these requirements are satisfied:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    $y - x + 1 = K$, and
  </li>
  <li>
    for each integer $p$ from $x$ to $y$, there is a soldier with power $p$ at position $q$ from the front of the line, satisfying $x \leq q \leq y$.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Si Pitung would like to carry out zero or more commands so his soldier lineup has at least one solid interval.
  Rotation commands can be carried out as many times as Si Pitung wants, however extension commands require more planning to be carried out.
  What is the minimum number of <b>extension commands</b> that has to be carried out by Si Pitung so that his soldier lineup has at least one solid interval?

<h3>Explanation of Sample</h3>

<p>
  Si Pitung can carry out the following commands, consisting of $2$ extension commands:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Rotation command.
    The lineup becomes $[1, 1, 4, 4]$.
  </li>
  <li>
    Extension command for a soldier of power $3$.
    The lineup becomes $[1, 1, 4, 4, 3]$.
  </li>
  <li>
    Rotation command.
    The lineup becomes $[3, 1, 1, 4, 4]$.
  </li>
  <li>
    Rotation command.
    The lineup becomes $[4, 3, 1, 1, 4]$.
  </li>
  <li>
    Extension command for a soldier of power $5$.
    The lineup becomes $[4, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5]$.
  </li>
  <li>
    Rotation command.
    The lineup becomes $[5, 4, 3, 1, 1, 4]$.
  </li>
  <li>
    Rotation command.
    The lineup becomes $[4, 5, 4, 3, 1, 1]$.
  </li>
  <li>
    Rotation command.
    The lineup becomes $[1, 4, 5, 4, 3, 1]$.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  After carrying out all the commands above, the interval $[3, 5]$ is a solid interval since the following conditions are satisfied:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>There is a soldier with power $3$ at position $5$ ($3 \leq 5 \leq 5$).</li>
  <li>There is a soldier with power $4$ at position $4$ ($3 \leq 5 \leq 5$).</li>
  <li>There is a soldier with power $5$ at position $3$ ($3 \leq 5 \leq 5$).</li>
</ul>
