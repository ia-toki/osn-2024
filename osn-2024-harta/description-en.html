<!-- Title: National Treasure -->

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
  There are $N$ plots of land numbered from $1$ to $N$ arranged in a circle.
  Plot $i$ is immediately to the left of plot $i + 1$ for each $1 \leq i \leq N - 1$, and plot $N$ is immediately to the left of plot $1$.
</p>
<p>
  Bu Dengklek knows that exactly one of the $N$ plots contains a treasure and she wants to find the location of that plot.
  To assist her search, on each plot $i$, Bu Dengklek installed a machine numbered $i$.
</p>
<p>
  In one operation, Bu Dengklek can choose an integer $k$ and activates $k$ different machines.
  After that, Bu Dengklek will obtain information about the shortest distance between the nearest active machine and the treasure.
  This operation costs $\left\lceil\frac{N}{k}\right\rceil$ Kwakkoins.
  After the operation, all active machines are deactivated again.
</p>
<p>
  Bu Dengklek has only $512$ Kwakkoins.
  Help Bu Dengklek find the location of the plot containing the treasure!
</p>
<p>
  Note:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Formally, the shortest distance between plot $x$ and plot $y$ ($x \leq y$) is the minimum of $y - x$ and $N - (y - x)$.</li>
  <li>$\lceil w\rceil$ for a real number $w$ denotes the value of $w$ rounded up.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
  <li>$N = 256$</li>
</ul>

<h3>Subtasks</h3>

<ol>
  <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;(9 points) The treasure is located on plot $1$.</li>
  <li>(15 points) The treasure is located on one of the plots $1$ through $3$ inclusive.</li>
  <li>(33 points) The treasure is located on one of the plots $1$ through $128$ inclusive.</li>
  <li>(43 points) No additional constraints.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Problem Type Information</h3>

<p>
  This is an "interactive" problem.
  In this problem, you will interact with the judge's program through the standard input (stdin) and the standard output (stdout).
  See the following interaction format carefully.
</p>

<h3>Interaction Format</h3>

<p>
  To perform an operation that activates $k$ machines $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_k$ ($1 \leq a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \ldots &lt; a_K \leq N$), you can output to the standard output in the following format:
</p>
<pre>
TANYA k
a<sub>1</sub> a<sub>2</sub> &hellip; a<sub>k</sub>
</pre>
<p>
Note that the machine numbers must be <b>strictly increasing</b>.
</p>
<p>
For each operation, you will be given the answer from the standard input in the following format:
</p>
<pre>
d
</pre>
<p>
This means, the shortest distance between an active machine and the treasure is $d$.
</p>
<p>
If you have located the treasure, for example on plot $z$, you can output to the standard output in the following format:
</p>
<pre>
JAWAB z
</pre>

<h3>Scoring</h3>

<p>
  Each operation that activates $k$ machines costs $\left\lceil\frac{N}{k}\right\rceil$ Kwakkoins.
  Let $C$ denote the total Kwakkoins over all operations.
  A $\text{PERFORMA}$ score is computed according to the following table:
</p>
<table border="1">
  <thead>
    <th>Condition</th>
    <th>$\text{PERFORMA}$</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody style="text-align: center;">
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left;">$512 &lt; C$</td>
      <td>$0\%$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$6 &lt; C \leq 512$</td>
      <td>$(100 - 5 \times \log_2(C - 5))\%$</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: right;">$C \leq 6$&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
      <td>$100\%$</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>
  For each test case, its $\text{PERFORMA}$ score is computed.
  Each subtask consists of multiple test cases.
  For each subtask, the smallest $\text{PERFORMA}$ score will be taken.
  The score for a subtask is the product of the smallest $\text{PERFORMA}$ score and the subtask points.
  The final score is the sum of the scores of all subtasks, which is then rounded down.
</p>
<p>
  Your program will receive "Wrong Answer" if it:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>uses more than $512$ Kwakkoins, or</li>
  <li>produces an output in a wrong format or outside of the constraints.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If a test case is successfully executed, you can see its detailed scoring in the submission page.
  You can also view the total Kwakkoins used for that test case.
</p>
<p>
  The grader is <b>not adaptive</b>.
  In other words, the location of the plot that contains the treasure is fixed before the interaction begins.
</p>

<h3>Sample Interaction</h3>

<p>
  The following is a possible sample interaction.
  In this example, the treasure is located on plot $42$.

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>(end)</td>
    <td>(end)</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  In the sample above, the total Kwakkoins used is $86 + 128 + 64 = 278$.
  Since $6 &lt; 278 \leq 512$ holds, then the $\text{PERFORMA}$ score is $(100 - 5 \times \log_2(278 - 5))\% \approx 59.536\%$.
