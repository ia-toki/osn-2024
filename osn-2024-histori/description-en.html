<!-- Title: Duck History -->

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
  Pak Dengklek reminisces about the time when he first started raising ducks.
</p>
<p>
  At first, Pak Dengklek did not have any ducks.
  Every day for $N$ consecutive days, he adopted a new duck.
  More specifically, at the end of the $i$-th day, Pak Dengklek adopted a duck that is $A_i$ days old.
  Note that the ages of the ducks that Pak Dengklek already owns will increase with each passing day.  
</p>
<p>
  Pak Dengklek is curious, at the end of each day, what is the age of the youngest duck, the oldest duck, and the average age of all his ducks?
</p>

<h3>Constraints</h3>

<ul>
  <li>$1 \leq N \leq 100\,000$</li>
  <li>$1 \leq A_i \leq 200\,000$</li>
</ul>

<h3>Subtasks</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    (10 points) Contains only the following test case:
<pre>
5
4 2 3 9 4
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>(16 points) $A_i = i$</li>
  <li>(12 points) $A_1 = A_2 = \ldots = A_N$</li>
  <li>(32 points) $N \leq 1000$</li>
  <li>(30 points) No additional constraints.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  For each subtask, you can obtain $50\%$ of the subtask points if you can only answer the youngest age and the oldest age correctly for each day (and not answer the average age correctly).
</p>

<h3>Input</h3>

<p>
  The input is given in the following format:
</p>
<pre>
N
A<sub>1</sub> A<sub>2</sub> &hellip; A<sub>N</sub>
</pre>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>
  Output $N$ rows, each consisting of two integers and a real number representing the age of the youngest duck, the age of the oldest duck, and the average age of all ducks respectively.
  The average age will be considered correct if its absolute difference with the judge's output is less than $10^{-2}$.
  Note that you must always output three numbers on each line, even if you intend to only obtain $50\%$ points.
</p>

<h3>Sample Input</h3>

<pre>
3 3 3.0000
1 4 2.5000
2 5 3.3333
3 7 5.0000
