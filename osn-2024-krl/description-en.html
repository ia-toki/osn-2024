<!-- Title: Electric Railway Trains -->

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
  In Jakarta, there are $N$ electric railway train stations lined up in a straight line, numbered from $1$ to $N$.
</p>
<p>
  There are $M$ train routes with their own dedicated tracks, numbered from $1$ to $M$.
  The $i$-th route consists of four numbers $A_i$, $B_i$, $C_i$, and $D_i$.
  The train for the $i$-th route travels both ways between stations $A_i$ and $B_i$ ($A_i &lt; B_i$).
  Each route serves two lines:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  	Commuter line: the train stops at every station between $A_i$ and $B_i$ inclusive.
  	The trip from station $x$ to station $y$ ($A_i \leq x, y \leq B_i$) costs $C_i \times |x - y|$.
  </li>
  <li>
  	Express line: the train only stops at stations $A_i$ and $B_i$.
  	The trip from station $A_i$ to station $B_i$ (or vice versa) costs $D_i$.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  To board a train, we need to buy a travel pass which costs $T$ at the departure station. 
  However, <b>inter-train transfer is free of charge</b>.
  If we end a train trip at a station and immediately board another train from that station, we can still use the same travel pass and there is no need to buy another pass.
  Upon exiting a station, the travel pass expires and we need to buy a new pass at the next station if we want to board a train again. 
</p>
<p>
  Outside the stations, there is also a city bus route which covers all stations.
  A bus trip from station $x$ to station $y$ costs $K \times |x - y|$.
</p>
<p>
  Bu Dengklek would like to travel from station $P$ to station $Q$ using trains or bus (or a combination of both).
  What is the lowest possible total cost?
</p>
<p>
  Note: $|x - y|$ denotes the difference of $x$ and $y$.

<p>
  Bu Dengklek would like to travel from station $9$ to station $5$.
  A possible trip is as follows:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>At station $9$, buy a travel pass which costs $1$ to board the route $1$ commuter train to station $10$ which costs $10 \times |9 - 10| = 10$.</li>
  <li>At station $10$, transfer for free to route $1$ express train to station $7$ which costs $8$.</li>
  <li>At station $7$, take the bus to station $6$ which costs $10 \times |7 - 6| = 10$.</li>
  <li>At station $6$, buy a travel pass which costs $1$ to board the route $2$ commuter train to station $5$ which costs $8 \times |6 - 5| = 8$.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  The total cost is $1 + 10 + 8 + 10 + 1 + 8 = 38$.

  Bu Dengklek would like to travel from station $2$ to station $14$.
  A possible optimal trip is as follows:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>At station $2$, buy a travel pass which costs $1$ to board the route $1$ commuter train to station $4$ which costs $2 \times |2 - 4| = 4$.</li>
  <li>At station $4$, transfer for free to route $2$ express train to station $7$ which costs $5$.</li>
  <li>At station $7$, transfer for free to route $1$ commuter train to station $9$ which costs $2 \times |7 - 9| = 4$.</li>
  <li>At station $9$, take the bus to station $12$ which costs $3 \times |12 - 9| = 9$.</li>
  <li>At station $12$, buy a travel pass which costs $1$ to board the route $3$ express train to station $15$ which costs $1$.</li>
  <li>At station $15$, transfer for free to route $3$ commuter train to station $14$ which costs $3 \times |15 - 14| = 3$.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  The total cost is $1 + 4 + 5 + 4 + 9 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 28$.
